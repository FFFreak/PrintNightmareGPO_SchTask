# PrintNightmareGPO_SchTask

A weekend quick and dirty to "hopefully" offer some protection from PrintNightmare - ACL originally based on TrueSec's suggestion then modified for a print server YMMV, and MS option #2 of disabling remote connections.

I cannot say this script is the perfect solution and tested minimally, but worked in my limited testing.  Please do your own testing!
